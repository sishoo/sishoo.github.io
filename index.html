    <p>Hi, I'm Mac.<br>

      Most of the day I am either coding, backpacking, or playing video games with my friends. <br>
      My favorite coding language is Rust, but I know others. I like to research and experiment on my own, testing
      hypotheses I make. <br>
      The thing that attracts me to coding is that I get to make whatever my heart desires.</p>

  <div class="content" id="projects-content">
    <p>Some of my projects include:<br>
      - A game engine written in Rust (work in progress)<br>
      - An automatic code documenter (work in progress)<br>
      - This portfolio<br>
      - Ray tracer written in C (work in progress)<br>
      - Particle simulation written in Rust<br>

      As you can see, a lot of my projects are a work in progress.<br>
      I like to work on big projects, even if they take a really long time.

  <div class="content" id="other-content">
    <h1>Coming Soon!</h1>
    <p>I am a novice artist. <br>
      I love pixel art and highly detailed pencil drawings. <br>
      Although I am not the best, I know I will get better in the future.<br>
      I am going to use this section of my portfolio to document my progress.
